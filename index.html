        <h3>Become a <span class="name-color"> Web Developer</span></h3>
        <p>My name is Razibul, I ve been studying computer science for two years. In order to kick-start my career before I graduate, I am looking for a job of a web developer, since thats what Ive been doing already for four years in my free time. Designing websites for friends, developing simple e-shops with the help of some open source content-management systems, and so on. Besides that I am a normal guy who enjoys hiking and spending time with friends, while not working or studying, which takes most of my time of course.</p>
